# Notes

We add new features and fix bugs periodically. Make sure you are constantly checking for the new updates that may result in better performance for the bot and the server.

# Prerequisites

It's good to have prior knowledge of Python, Discord.py library and Discord. If you don't have any idea of the three links mentioned above, then this project may be a little bit more difficult.

# About

The <span style=color:#5539CC> ***Wordle Solver Discord Bot*** <span style="color:white"> was created for individuals that have a hard time completing standard wordles. We integrated this program into discord, for ease of access. The bot is hosted online 24/7 and has a bank of over *5,000 5-letter words*.

### *What is This?*

This bot allows you to finish wordles successfully. The <span style=color:#5539CC> ***Wordle Solver Discord Bot*** <span style="color:white"> will suggest a word to use, and then will ask for your input on what the word did for you. You go back and forth while the bot narrows down the word, and you'll solve it 100% of the time. 

### *Why This Project?*

There is no actual answer for this question! We understand that a bot like this may ruin the fun for some, but it was a great journey creating this with the team. We strongly encourage that you still try to solve wordles by yourself as it increases brain functionality, but if you ever get stuck, we're here for you. That's why the <span style=color:#5539CC> ***Wordle Solver Discord Bot*** <span style="color:white"> does what it does.

### *How does it Work?*

Watch this short video on how to use the bot.

# Functionalities

The <span style=color:#5539CC> ***Wordle Solver Discord Bot*** <span style="color:white"> solves hundreds of equations every second to narrow the possibility of each word left in the word bank. Once the bot is aware of letters that no longer are present in the word, it performs these carefully written equations to remove the other words. We use a system of <span style=color:#57ac57> ***'012'*** <span style="color:white"> so that the user can enter input quickly. The bot will say <span style=color:#004aad> ***"Try angry."*** <span style="color:white">. Once you test this word, you then feed the bot input through the same channel. <span style=color:#57ac57> ***0*** <span style="color:white"> means that the letter is not in the word, <span style=color:#57ac57> ***1*** <span style="color:white"> means that the letter is present in the word, but in the wrong position, and <span style=color:#57ac57> ***2*** <span style="color:white"> means it is present, and it is in the right position. (Ex. 00210) Once enough words have been tested, the bot will finally say <span style=color:#57ac57> ***"The word is apple!"*** <span style="color:white">. Just like that, you have solved the wordle. Easy, right?
